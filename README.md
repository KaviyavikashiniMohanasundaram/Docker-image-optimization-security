Docker Image Optimization and Security

📌 Overview

This project focuses on containerizing a Node.js or Python application using Docker within an Ubuntu (VirtualBox) environment to achieve consistent, lightweight, and secure deployments. It emphasizes Docker best practices like using Alpine base images, implementing .dockerignore, multi-stage builds, and scanning containers for vulnerabilities.

🎯 Objective

Ensure consistent and reproducible environments across systems

Optimize image size and performance using best practices

Strengthen container security through non-root users and vulnerability scanning

Streamline development, testing, and deployment workflows

Lay the foundation for production and cloud-ready containers
